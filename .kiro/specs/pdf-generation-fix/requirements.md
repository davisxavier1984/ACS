# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PDF generation functionality in the municipal ACS dashboard has several critical issues that prevent proper PDF creation and cause memory leaks. This feature needs to be completely refactored to provide reliable, professional PDF reports with proper error handling and resource management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a municipal health administrator, I want to generate PDF reports from the ACS dashboard, so that I can share official documentation with stakeholders and maintain records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Gerar PDF" THEN the system SHALL generate a complete PDF report without errors
2. WHEN PDF generation is initiated THEN the system SHALL display proper loading indicators and progress feedback
3. WHEN the PDF is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a download button with the correct filename
4. IF PDF generation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the PDF generation to handle resources properly, so that the application doesn't consume excessive memory or crash.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating PDFs THEN the system SHALL properly manage memory usage and cleanup resources
2. WHEN converting Plotly charts to images THEN the system SHALL handle image conversion without memory leaks
3. WHEN PDF generation completes THEN the system SHALL release all temporary resources and file handles
4. IF image conversion fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and continue PDF generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PDF report to have professional formatting and layout, so that it can be used for official presentations and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PDF is generated THEN it SHALL have consistent margins, spacing, and professional appearance
2. WHEN charts are included THEN they SHALL be properly sized and positioned without overlapping content
3. WHEN multiple pages are needed THEN the system SHALL handle page breaks correctly
4. WHEN tables are included THEN they SHALL be properly formatted with appropriate styling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PDF generation code to be maintainable and debuggable, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF generation encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the code SHALL have clear separation of concerns and modular functions
3. WHEN modifications are required THEN the code SHALL be well-documented and easy to understand
4. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide timing information and resource usage metrics
